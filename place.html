<div class="text">
  <p>
    The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest feline species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. It is known for its powerful build and distinctive coat pattern, with rosettes covering its body.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jaguars inhabit rainforests, swamps, and grasslands throughout Central and South America, with the Amazon Rainforest being their primary habitat. They are solitary and territorial animals, mainly hunting at night.
  </p>
  <p>
    This apex predator plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystems where it lives by controlling the population of other animals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite their strength and adaptability, jaguars are threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these majestic creatures and their habitats.
